            <h1>Diabetes care: 10 ways to avoid complications</h1>
        </div>

            <div class=context>
                <div>
                    <h2>1. Make a commitment to managing your diabetes</h2>
                    <p>Members of your diabetes care team — primary care provider, diabetes care and education
                        specialist, and dietitian, for example — can help you learn the basics of diabetes care and
                        offer support along the way. But it's up to you to manage your condition.

                        Learn all you can about diabetes. Make healthy eating and physical activity part of your daily
                        routine. Maintain a healthy weight.

                        Monitor your blood sugar, and follow your health care provider's instructions for managing your
                        blood sugar level. Take your medications as directed by your health care provider. Ask your
                        diabetes treatment team for help when you need it</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>2. Don't smoke</h2>
                    <p>Avoid smoking or quit smoking if you smoke. Smoking increases your risk of type 2 diabetes and
                        the risk of various diabetes complications, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduced blood flow in the legs and feet, which can lead to infections, nonhealing ulcers and
                            possible amputation</li>
                        <li>Worse blood sugar control</li>
                        <li>Heart disease</li>
                        <li>Stroke</li>
                        <li>Eye disease, which can lead to blindness</li>
                        <li>Nerve damage</li>
                        <li>Kidney disease</li>
                        <li>Premature death</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Talk to your health care provider about ways to help you stop smoking or using other types of tobacco. </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>3. Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol under control</h2>
                    <p>Like diabetes, high blood pressure can damage your blood vessels. High cholesterol is a concern, too, since the resulting damage is often worse and more rapid when you have diabetes. When these conditions team up, they can lead to a heart attack, stroke or other life-threatening conditions.

                        Eating a healthy, reduced-fat and low salt diet, avoiding excess alcohol, and exercising regularly can go a long way toward controlling high blood pressure and cholesterol. Your health care provider may also recommend taking prescription medication, if necessary.</p>
